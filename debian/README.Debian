NaN package for Octave
======================

Since this package changes the way NaNs are handled in Octave (by overloading
several core functions), it is not loaded by default upon Octave startup.

In order to use its functions, the user must explicitly ask Octave to load the
package with the following command:

 pkg load nan

In case the user wants to have the package loaded by default in every session,
this command can be added to ~/.octaverc.
